        <p>His Excellency, The President launched the Scoping Report for the SEA of Potential Oil and Gas Development in Sierra Leone on 13th March 2012.</p>
        <p>In his address, H.E. President Koroma noted that when any major new mineral resource is discovered and exploited this can have major macro-economic benefits but it can also give rise to development pressures which have both beneficial and adverse social consequences at regional and local level.</p>
        <p>In addition, unless development is handled with great care serious adverse environmental impacts can be caused for marine life, fisheries and coastal tourism development.</p>
        <p>A Steering group has been set up including a wide range of Government Ministries and Agencies. They include:</p>
