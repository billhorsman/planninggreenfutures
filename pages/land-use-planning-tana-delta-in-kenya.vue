    <h2>Land Use Planning and SEA for the Tana Delta in Kenya</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>Pgf consulting is currently assisting the Government of Kenya (Office of the Prime Minister) and Nature Kenya to develop the first Land Use Plan for the Tana Delta, an internationally important Biodiversity Hotspot on the East African Coast.</p>
        <p>The Delta is home to 96,000 people from three main ethnic groups who engage in pastoralism, farming and fishing.</p>
        <p>The Delta is under enormous pressure from climate change, human activity, overgrazing, and development &mdash; including the planned new Port of Lamu which is being designed to export oil from Uganda, Sudan and potentially Kenya.</p>
        <p>Many other developments are also planned including irrigated rice and sugar and biofuels.</p>
        <p>The Land Use Plan and accompanying SEA was adopted by Government and the two County Councils in June, 2015.</p>
